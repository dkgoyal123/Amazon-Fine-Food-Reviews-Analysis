Amazon Fine Food Reviews is a classic sentiment analysis problem used to classify the polarity of the reviews. In this problem we have given reviews of products and task is to separate the positive reviews and negative reviews.So it is a classification problem. Firstly, we have reduce the dimensonality of data for visualization. We have used t-SNE(t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) for this purpose. Then after we have applied LSTM(long short term memory) because a review is nothing but a sequence of characters and we know that LSTM process sequence information very well. So we have used LSTM which is a deep learning technique and as expected, we got the best accuracy on LSTM.
